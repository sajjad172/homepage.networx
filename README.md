 <p><em><strong>Have you ever though of how the internet works or is interested in coding? We have provided all the things you need to know to get into the coding world! </strong></em></p>
</div>
<h5><strong>What is coding?</strong></h5>
<p> Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.</p>
<h5><strong>Why should you code?</strong></h5>
<p>We all have hopes, dreams, and plans for the future. Whether you’re looking for a new opportunity, want to optimize your current job, or are simply searching for a new hobby, coding can help you get closer to your goals. And remember, anyone can learn how to code!</p>
<h5><strong>Make cool stuff</strong></h5>
<p><em> Ever wanted to make an app or a website? Code does that. It can also help you automate a spreadsheet or create new tools for your community. Learning to code makes it possible to imagine the things you want to make and actually build them. You also have loads of fun!</em></p>

    <h2 style="color:Violet ;">Taxes</h2>
    <img src="https://d1dh93s7n44ml6.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/03095853/analyze-your-taxes.jpg" alt="taxes picture" height="260">

     <div style="text-align:center">
 <p><em><strong>Do you want learn how taxes work ? It may seem complicated so we have provided infromation to help! </strong></em></p>
</div>
<h5><strong>What are taxes?</strong></h5>
<p> Taxes are money collected by the government for the purpose of funding government operations. Before the income tax, the US government mostly funded its operations with import taxes known as tariffs.
These days, Americans pay many types of taxes. They include income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, sin or excise taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate taxes. People disagree about how high taxes should be. Some say that when taxes are too high the economy can’t grow. Others argue that robust taxation helps distribute income and provide for the common good.
One of the aspects of taxation that’s hard for some people to accept is that pretty much everyone pays for something they don’t use, and a lot of us pay for things that we don’t like. For example, your taxes may help fund public schools that your kids don’t go to or policies you don’t agree with. That – and the bite taxes take out of our budgets – is part of why raising taxes can be a tough sell politically.
Unless you don’t work or you work under the table, you prepay part of your tax bill throughout the year through payroll taxes. Payroll taxes deduct tax money from your paycheck and from your employer’s coffers to help pre-pay your income taxes and to pay your Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Your pre-tax earnings get reduced by approximately 30% before they hit your bank account, which is why post-tax earnings are always lower than the salary you negotiated with your boss when you decided to take the job. That is why it’s important to know the difference between pre-tax and post-tax dollars. </p>
<h5><strong>Direct Taxes</strong></h5>
<p>The definition of a direct tax is a tax that is paid straight from the individual or business to the government body that imposes the tax. Examples of direct taxes include individual income taxes (paid to the federal and state governments), corporate taxes (paid on an organization’s profits), and property taxes (paid on the value of real estate).Direct taxes are based on a percentage of the value of what is being taxed, and they are set by state and federal law.</p>
<h5><strong>Indirect Taxes</strong></h5>
<p>Indirect taxes are typically added on transactions for goods and services like imports, gas, alcohol and tobacco. They include sales taxes, value-added taxes, sin or excise taxes, and tariffs. These taxes are considered indirect because they do not flow straight from the payer to the government. For example, when you pay a sales tax you don’t actually pay that money to the government. The merchant who sells your goods pays the sales tax to the government. Unlike direct taxes, indirect taxes are imposed at the same rate for each transaction, without taking into account the wealth of the person. Critics say this is unfair because it taxes the income of a poorer person more than a wealthier one.</p>
<h5><strong>Tax Expenditures</strong></h5>
<p> Tax expenditures are defined by the law as “revenue losses” from special tax code provisions that can help taxpayers lower taxes. Examples of these include tax deductions and tax credits. The government can choose to forgo tax revenue to provide financial assistance to different groups of taxpayers, and promote activities that could benefit the economy or a community, like buying a home or donating to charity.A tax deduction reduces your taxable income. As a result you pay lower taxes. The higher your tax bracket (the percentage of the income that you owe in taxes) the more valuable a tax deduction is. As an example, a $500 tax deduction is worth much more to someone in the 35% tax bracket than someone in the 15% tax bracket because 35% of $500 ($175) is more than 15% of $500 ($75).

<h5><strong> Bottom Line</strong></h5>
<p>You can’t avoid paying taxes. But understanding how taxes work can empower you to make smart choices about managing your finances and getting the highest net income. A good tax plan can set up your personal finances strategically to take advantage of different tax breaks and tax credits. And this could help reduce how much you owe in taxes.</p>
